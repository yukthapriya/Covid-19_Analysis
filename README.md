# Covid-19_Analysis
Based on a dataset that contains the cumulative number of covid cases for a state/country.
A small program that would download the dataset, and displays the following information:
1.  Countries having more than 5000000 confirmed cases by 29th May 2021.
2.  Name of the state/country having the most number of recovery on a day.
3.  Timeline of the number of cases per day (not cumulative) by state/country.
4.  Timeline of the status of the countries. Countries with more than 500,000 cases on that day, should be classified as red, more than 100,000 as orange, more than 
     10,000 as yellow, and others as green.
